# Troubleshoot
To install Portmaster on R36S, download the **Install.Full.PortMaster.sh** file [Github link](https://github.com/PortsMaster/PortMaster-GUI/releases) and put on your SD card, after that launch it on the device. I put it in the **./ports** folder.
If the game doesn't launch, open Portmaster and got to **"Manage Ports"** and reinstall the game.
If the box art doesn't show, check the path to the image in the **gameinfo.xml** file. Or do the step above.
