## Overview

An updated version of the classic arcade blast 'em up, this game features full 3D environments, all-new weapons and defense systems and a 2-player split-screen mode. The gameplay is exactly the same. Pilot a spacecraft and destroy the oncoming asteroids, each of different sizes, defeating the enemy boss at the end of each level. Alien ships and black holes are also out there, along with ship upgrades that update your ship's weapons and defense systems.
Multiplayer options comprise cooperative and competitive options.
