## Overview

Kratos' second appearance on a portable platform, God of War: Ghost of Sparta is a spin-off set between the events of God of War and God of War II . Kratos has become god of war, but his nightmarish visions haven't left him. In one such vision, he sees his mother, Callisto, being kept in Atlantis, the domain of the sea god Poseidon. Despite the advice of Athena to ignore it, Kratos starts the new journey to uncover his past and ultimately save his long lost brother, Deimos, from the god of death, Thanatos. The second PSP title features similar gameplay to its predecessor, with few new gameplay mechanics. Kratos uses his Blades of Athena in this quest, which he now could temporary empower with a new magic, Thera's Bane, resulting in stronger attacks. Also present are several new magic items and a new secondary weapon. Beside the story mode, Ghost of Sparta features "Temple of Zeus", a location where different art and other bonuses could be purchased by spending orbs, collected in the Battle Arena.
