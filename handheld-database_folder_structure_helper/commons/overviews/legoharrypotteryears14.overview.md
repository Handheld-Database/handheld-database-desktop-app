## Overview


**Lego Harry Potter: Years 1â€“4** is a action-adventure game developed by Traveller's Tales and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. The game is based on the Lego Harry Potter toy line, and its storyline covers the first four books by J.K. Rowling and its film adaptations in the Harry Potter film series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001), Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002), Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004), and Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005).

**Gameplay** is similar to that of most previous Lego video games, with an emphasis on collecting, exploring, and solving puzzles. Casting spells is an integral part of the gameplay, with a wide range of spells available for unlocking as the player progresses. As there are many spells available in the game, the player can use the spell wheel to select the spell. Potion-making is another integral feature; potions can help the player complete levels or, if created incorrectly, have adverse side effects such as turning the player into a frog.
