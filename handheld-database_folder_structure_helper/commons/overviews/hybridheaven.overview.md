## Overview

Aliens are trying to take over the US by eventually replacing the President with a clone. To do this, they begin by replacing advisors and Secret Service operatives with clones. One of these clones is scheduled to meet with a collaborator named Diaz in a Manhattan Subway, to get weapons for the Presidential Replacement. The clone arrives at the meeting, and sees Diaz with two Men in Black. As the clone approaches, Diaz starts hearing voices, and shoots the clone.

His fall is slowed by the anti-gravity device that powers the elevator, and he begins his journey into the underground facility. Gameplay: Two styles of gameplay: Overworld and Battle.
