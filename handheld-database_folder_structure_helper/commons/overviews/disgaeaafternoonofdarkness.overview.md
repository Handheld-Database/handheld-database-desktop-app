## Overview

Prince Laharl awakens to find his father, King Krichevskoy, dead, and his throne being stolen from him. Now the prince must battle his way through a magical realm filled with countless demons to take back his rule of the Netherworld. Played in an isometric turn-based style similar to Final Fantasy Tactics , Afternoon of Darkness is an enhanced remake of the PS2 game, Disgaea: Hour of Darkness . It features additional optional bosses and the ability to play an alternate story campaign as Etna had she succeeded in killing Prince Laharl. A new multiplayer mode has been added to the US version and the Japanese re-release called Makai Senki Disgaea: Tsshin Taisen Hajimemashita . The PC port contains updated graphics (backgrounds only, not the character sprites), an updated UI, and Steam achievements, in addition to having all the content that was in the PSP edition.
