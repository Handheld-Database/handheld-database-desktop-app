## Overview

Bomberman's entry onto the PSP delivers the classical gameplay with loads of levels and gadgets, rendered entirely in 3D. White bomberman is back and is ready to erase the darkness plaguing the known worlds. After clearing each world of darkness, you will fly onto the next one, with ranging terrains from desert (with portal sand-pits), snow (with ice blocks that will let you slide across), fire (with dangerous volcanic and otherwise unstable levels), and other. And as long as you don't get killed, you are left with all the equipped gadgets until the very end. Even if you're killed, you're left with all the collected items thus far. You can equip items either prior or during the level gameplay. All the classical gadgets and gizmos are back and then some. You proceed to the next level by defeating all enemies and finding an exit door before the time runs out. In addition to story mode which features 100 levels in total, game offers a classic mode with 50 levels of the original Bomberman, and a battle mode to take it up on your friends.
