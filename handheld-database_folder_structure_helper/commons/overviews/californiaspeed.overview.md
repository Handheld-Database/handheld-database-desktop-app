## Overview

California Speed has you racing through, of course, California, with a range of different tracks based on the real maps of the state, with short-cuts and branching roads adding choice and variety. Cars include a collection of fast cars, as well as F1 cars and golf-carts, and you can customize your car's paint to suit your style. Split-screen two-player racing is supported.
