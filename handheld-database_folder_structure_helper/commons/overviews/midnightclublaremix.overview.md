## Overview

The Midnight Club series returns to the PSP after a three year absence. This title was released to coincide with the release of Midnight Club: Los Angeles for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. It provides a similarly themed Los Angeles street racing experience using the tried and tested Midnight Club formula. The graphics have been improved since the last PSP offering with some new racing modes thrown into the mix. Midnight Club: L.A. Remix has left the strict race route format in favour of open-world exploration. It passes through realistic day and night cycles meaning that races are no longer performed only at midnight. A variety of cars and motorcycles are on offer as the game progresses and dynamic weather alters vehicle performance. Damage modelling has been added and careless drivers soon find the performance of their car degraded and face large repair fees at the end of the race.
