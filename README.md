# Application to make the contribution to the Handheld Database easier.

## About
This application is work in progress. You will be able to use it to add Platforms, Systems and Games to those systems. You will be able to do everything visually, like now through the scripts.

## TO DO
- Make the UI for the Platfrom, System and Game windows
- Make the UI for the manual game and automatic game contribution.
- Implement all the functionality that exists in the scripts.
- Maybe, put all classes in different files.
- Clean up the folders (duplicate scripts, etc...).
- Make a test build off the application. For Windows and Linux.
